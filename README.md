# ATAT Web API
The ATAT Web API repo contains an implementation of the internal application programming interface that supports the [ATAT Web UI](https://github.com/dod-ccpo/atat-web-ui). This API will eventually invoke the [ATAT CSP Orchestration](https://github.com/dod-ccpo/atat-csp-orchestration) layer.

## Deploying to AWS
The document contains helpful information for installing and deploying the implementation of the _ATAT Portfolio Drafts API_ to AWS. [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (AWS CDK) framework is used for deployment. The `cdk.json` provides configuration to the AWS CDK Toolkit.

Prior to running a CDK command such as `cdk synth` it is necessary to generate file `schema.json` by executing `npm run generate-schema`. This file is also generated by `npm run build` and `npm run test`. If you run either of these prior to the CDK command then file `schema.json` will already have been generated in the local file system.

```
npm run generate-schema
cdk synth
```

Without first generating this file you will encounter an error during asset bundling.  For example:

> error: Could not resolve "../../models/schema.json"
